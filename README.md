# Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax Algorithm Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of the minimax algorithm for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## How to Use
To use this implementation, simply clone the repository and run the ```main.py``` file. The game will start and you can play against the computer, which uses the minimax algorithm to determine its moves.

## Minimax Algorithm
The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that is commonly used in game theory. It is used to determine the best possible move for a player, assuming that the other player will also make the best possible move.

In the context of Tic-Tac-Toe, the minimax algorithm works by recursively evaluating all possible moves and their outcomes. It assigns a score to each possible move, with a positive score indicating a good move for the computer and a negative score indicating a good move for the player. The algorithm then chooses the move with the highest score.
